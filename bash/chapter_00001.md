# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Course Overview
Welcome to the Bash Scripting Course! This course is designed to take you from a beginner to an advanced level in Bash scripting. You will learn how to automate tasks, manage files, and create powerful scripts to enhance your productivity.

## What is Bash?
Bash (Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. It is widely available on various operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL). Bash is both a command interpreter and a scripting language, allowing users to execute commands and write scripts to automate tasks.

## Setting Up the Environment
Before we start writing Bash scripts, we need to set up our environment. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Linux
Most Linux distributions come with Bash pre-installed. You can open a terminal and start using Bash right away.

### macOS
macOS also comes with Bash pre-installed. Open the Terminal application to start using Bash.

### Windows
For Windows users, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine. Follow these steps to set up WSL:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
2. Restart your computer if prompted.
3. Open the Microsoft Store and install a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
4. Open the installed Linux distribution and complete the initial setup.

Alternatively, you can use Git Bash, which is a standalone application that provides a Bash emulation environment on Windows. Download and install Git Bash from the official Git website.

### Text Editor
Choose a text editor to write your Bash scripts. Some popular options include:
- Visual Studio Code
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- Vim
- Nano

Make sure to configure your text editor to use Unix-style line endings (LF) to avoid issues with script execution.

## Conclusion
In this chapter, we introduced the course, explained what Bash is, and provided instructions for setting up the environment. In the next chapter, we will dive into the basics of Bash scripting, starting with writing our first "Hello World" script.
