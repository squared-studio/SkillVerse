# IP Catalog and Integration in Vivado

In this chapter, we will explore how to use the IP Catalog in Vivado to integrate pre-built Intellectual Property (IP) cores into your design. The IP Catalog provides a wide range of IP cores that can be easily configured and added to your project, saving development time and effort.

## Accessing the IP Catalog

1. Open your project in Vivado.
2. In the Flow Navigator, click on "IP Catalog" under the "Project Manager" section.
3. The IP Catalog window will open, displaying a list of available IP cores organized by category.

## Adding an IP Core to Your Design

1. In the IP Catalog, browse or search for the IP core you want to add to your design.
2. Double-click on the IP core to open the "Customize IP" dialog.
3. Configure the IP core parameters as needed for your design requirements.
4. Click "OK" to add the IP core to your project.

## Integrating the IP Core

1. In the Flow Navigator, click on "Add Sources" and select "Add or Create Design Sources."
2. Click "Next" and then "Add Files" to add the IP core files to your project.
3. Click "Finish" to complete the integration process.
4. Use the IP Integrator tool to connect the IP core to other parts of your design.

## Generating the IP Core

1. In the Flow Navigator, click on "Generate Output Products" under the "IP Integrator" section.
2. Select the IP core and click "Generate" to create the necessary files for the IP core.
3. Once the generation process is complete, the IP core will be ready for use in your design.

## Example: Adding a FIFO IP Core

1. Open the IP Catalog and search for "FIFO."
2. Double-click on the "FIFO Generator" IP core to open the "Customize IP" dialog.
3. Configure the FIFO parameters, such as data width and depth, according to your design requirements.
4. Click "OK" to add the FIFO IP core to your project.
5. Use the IP Integrator tool to connect the FIFO IP core to other modules in your design.

By following these steps, you can efficiently integrate IP cores from the Vivado IP Catalog into your design, leveraging pre-built components to accelerate your development process.
