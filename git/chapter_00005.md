# Merge Conflicts

## What is a Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. This usually happens when two branches modify the same line in a file or when one branch deletes a file that the other branch modifies. Merge conflicts must be resolved manually by the developer.

## How to Identify a Merge Conflict

When a merge conflict occurs, Git will mark the conflicted areas in the affected files. The conflict markers look like this:
```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Your changes
=======
# Changes from the branch being merged
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

## Steps to Resolve a Merge Conflict

1. **Identify the Conflict:**
   Open the files with conflicts to see the conflict markers.

2. **Resolve the Conflict:**
   Edit the file to resolve the conflict by choosing one of the changes, combining them, or making a new change. Remove the conflict markers after resolving.

3. **Stage the Resolved File:**
   ```bash
   git add path/to/conflicted-file
   ```

4. **Commit the Merge:**
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Merge a branch into the current branch
$ git merge feature-branch

# Resolve conflicts in the files
# Open the conflicted files and resolve the conflicts

# Stage the resolved files
$ git add path/to/conflicted-file

# Commit the merge
$ git commit
```

## Tips for Avoiding Merge Conflicts

1. **Communicate with Your Team:**
   Regularly communicate with your team to avoid working on the same parts of the codebase simultaneously.

2. **Pull Changes Frequently:**
   Frequently pull changes from the remote repository to keep your local branch up-to-date.

3. **Use Feature Branches:**
   Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes to isolate changes and reduce the risk of conflicts.

4. **Resolve Conflicts Early:**
   Resolve conflicts as soon as they arise to avoid accumulating unresolved conflicts.

By understanding and resolving merge conflicts, you ensure that your code integrates smoothly with the changes from other branches, maintaining the integrity of the project.
