# Git Workflow Guide

This guide outlines effective Git workflows for both team collaboration and open-source contributions. Choosing the right workflow ensures smooth development, minimizes conflicts, and maintains a clean project history.

## Basic Git Workflow (Team Collaboration)

This workflow is ideal for teams working on a shared repository, typically within an organization. It emphasizes feature-based development and code review.

### Standard Development Cycle

```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url> && cd <repository-name>
    ```
    *   **Pro Tip:**  For enhanced security, use SSH instead of HTTPS.
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:<team>/<repo>.git
        ```

2.  **Create a Feature Branch**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/<feature-name>
    ```
    or for bug fixes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/<issue-name>
    ```
    *   **Branch Naming Convention**: Use prefixes to categorize branches:
        *   `feat/` for new features
        *   `fix/` for bug fixes
        *   `docs/` for documentation changes
        *   `chore/` for maintenance tasks
        *   Use `kebab-case` for branch names (e.g., `feat/user-authentication`)

3.  **Develop and Make Atomic Changes**
    *   Focus on implementing a single feature or fix within each branch.
    *   Make small, logical, and self-contained commits.
    *   Test your changes thoroughly locally before committing. Consider unit tests and integration tests as appropriate.

4.  **Stage and Commit Changes**
    ```bash
    git add . # Stage all changes in the working directory
    git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <subject>"
    ```
    *   **Commit Message Guide**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear and structured commit messages.
        *   **Type**:  `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf` etc.
        *   **Scope** (optional):  Specify the area of the codebase (e.g., `login`, `api`, `database`).
        *   **Subject**:  Concise description of the change (limit to 72 characters).
        *   Example: `feat(login): add email validation to signup form`

5.  **Push to Remote Repository**
    ```bash
    git push origin <feature-branch-name>
    ```

6.  **Create a Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR)**
    *   Initiate a PR/MR from your feature branch to the `main` (or `develop`) branch via your Git platform (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
    *   **Link Issues**: Reference related issue tracker IDs in the PR description (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Resolves #456`).
    *   **Request Reviews**:  Assign relevant team members for code review.
    *   **CI/CD Checks**: Ensure all automated checks (tests, linting) pass before merging.

7.  **Merge and Cleanup**
    *   **Squash Commits (Optional but Recommended)**:  Squashing merges your feature branch commits into a single, clean commit on the `main` branch, simplifying history. This is often preferred for feature branches.
    *   **Delete Remote Branch**: After successful merging, delete the feature branch on the remote repository to keep things tidy.
        ```bash
        git branch -d <feature-branch-name> # Delete local branch (already done)
        git push origin --delete <feature-branch-name> # Delete remote branch
        ```

8.  **Stay Updated with the `main` Branch**
    Regularly synchronize your local `main` branch with the remote `main` branch to avoid drift and merge conflicts.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull --rebase origin main
    ```
    *   `--rebase` is preferred to keep a linear and cleaner history, avoiding unnecessary merge commits.

## Advanced Workflow (Open-Source Contribution)

This workflow is commonly used for contributing to open-source projects where you don't have direct write access to the main repository. It involves forking and contributing through pull requests.

### Fork & Contribute Flow

    A[Fork Repository] --> B{Clone Fork}
    B --> C{Add Upstream}
    C --> D{Branch}
    D -- Topic Branch --> E[Code]
    E --> F[Commit]
    F --> G[Push to Fork]
    G --> H{Create Pull Request}
    H -- To Upstream --> I[Sync Fork]
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#06f
    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#06f
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    *   Navigate to the original repository on GitHub (or GitLab, etc.).
    *   Click the **"Fork"** button, usually located at the top right. This creates a copy of the repository in your personal account.

    *Illustration of Fork Button on GitHub:*
    ```
    Fork Button: (GitHub â†’ "Fork" button at the top-right of the repository page)
    ```
    *(Unfortunately, I cannot directly display images. Imagine a button labeled "Fork" on the top right of a GitHub repository page.)*

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
    Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo>.git
    cd <repo>
    ```

3.  **Add Upstream Remote**
    Configure a remote named `upstream` that points to the original repository. This allows you to sync changes from the original repository.
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream [https://github.com/original/](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/original/)<repo>.git
    ```
    Verify the setup:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```
    You should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (original repo) listed.

4.  **Create a Topic Branch**
    Create a dedicated branch for your contribution.  Similar to feature branches, but often called "topic branches" in open-source context.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/header-styling
    ```

5.  **Develop and Commit Changes**
    ```bash
    git add -p  # Use interactive staging to review changes before staging
    git commit -m "fix(ui): correct header padding on main header"
    ```

6.  **Push to Your Fork**
    Push your topic branch to *your forked repository* (`origin`).
    ```bash
    git push origin <topic-branch-name>
    ```

7.  **Create an Upstream Pull Request**
    *   Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub.
    *   Use the "Compare & pull request" button (or similar) to create a new pull request.
    *   **"Compare across forks"**: Ensure your pull request is directed from your fork and topic branch to the *original repository's* `main` (or designated) branch.
    *   **Testing Evidence**: In the PR comments, clearly describe the changes and provide evidence of testing (manual testing steps, screenshots, test results, etc.) to help maintainers understand and review your contribution.

8.  **Keep Your Fork Fresh and Synchronized**
    It's crucial to keep your fork's `main` branch synchronized with the original repository's `main` branch to avoid conflicts and ensure you are working with the latest code.
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main  # Rebase your local main branch onto upstream/main
    git push --force-with-lease origin main # Update your fork's main branch
    ```
    *   `git fetch upstream`: Fetches branches and commits from the `upstream` repository.
    *   `git rebase upstream/main`: Replays your local `main` branch commits on top of the fetched `upstream/main`, creating a linear history.  **Rebasing is generally preferred over merging** in this workflow for a cleaner history and easier PR integration.
    *   `git push --force-with-lease origin main`:  Force-pushes your rebased `main` branch to your `origin` (fork).  `--force-with-lease` is a safer alternative to `force` as it prevents overwriting remote changes if the remote branch has diverged unexpectedly.
    *   **Important:** **Never force-push to shared branches** in team collaboration workflows. Force-pushing is generally safe to *your own fork*.

## Workflow Comparison

| Aspect                     | Basic Workflow (Team)          | Advanced Workflow (Open-Source) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Repository Access**      | Direct clone (write access)    | Fork + clone (indirect access) |
| **Remote Setup**           | Single `origin` remote         | `origin` (fork) + `upstream` (original) remotes |
| **Branch Strategy**        | Feature branches               | Topic branches                  |
| **Synchronization Approach** | Regular `pull --rebase` from `origin/main` | `rebase upstream/main` to sync fork |
| **Pull Request Target**    | Same repository (`main` branch) | Cross-fork (to original repo)  |
| **Typical Maintainer Role** | Team members, project owners   | External maintainers, community |
| **Complexity**             | Simpler                         | More complex due to forking and upstream sync |
| **Use Case**               | Internal team projects         | Open-source contributions, external collaborations |

## Best Practices for Both Workflows

These practices enhance code quality, collaboration, and workflow efficiency in both basic and advanced Git workflows.

### Code Quality

*   **Linting and Formatting**:
    *   Run linters and formatters before committing to maintain consistent code style and catch potential errors early.
        ```bash
        npm run lint # Example for Node.js projects
        npm run format # Example for code formatting
        npm run test  # Run your test suite
        ```
    *   Consider integrating linters and formatters into your editor or pre-commit hooks for automatic checks.
*   **Keep Pull Requests Small and Focused**:
    *   Aim for PRs that are focused on a single feature, fix, or improvement.
    *   Smaller PRs are easier to review, understand, and merge, reducing review time and potential for errors.
    *   Ideally, keep PRs under 300-500 lines of code changes as a general guideline.

### Branch Synchronization

*   **Regularly Sync with the Base Branch**: Stay up-to-date with the `main` (or `develop`) branch to minimize merge conflicts and ensure you are building on the latest changes.

    ```bash
    # For basic workflow
    git pull --rebase origin main

    # For advanced workflow
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```

### Pull Request (PR) Etiquette

1.  **Use a PR Template**:
    *   Utilize a well-defined PR template (provided by your team or project) to ensure all necessary information is included.  A good template typically includes sections for:
        *   **Description of Changes**: Clearly explain what the PR does and why.
        *   **Screenshots/GIFs (if applicable)**:  Visual evidence for UI changes or bug fixes.
        *   **Testing Steps**: Detail how reviewers can manually test the changes.
        *   **Related Issues**: Link to relevant issue tracker tickets.
2.  **Respond Promptly to Reviews**:
    *   Actively engage with reviewers, address their comments and questions promptly, and iterate on your code based on feedback.
3.  **Update Branch Before Final Merge**:
    *   Before merging, always re-sync your branch with the latest base branch (`main` or `upstream/main`) to resolve any potential last-minute conflicts.
4.  **Keep PRs Drafts for Work in Progress**:
    *   Use "Draft" PRs to share work in progress and get early feedback, signaling that the PR is not yet ready for final review and merge.

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

| Issue                          | Solution                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Outdated Branch**            | `git rebase origin/main` (or `upstream/main`) to sync with the base branch. |
| **Broken CI Pipeline**         | Run tests and linters locally *before* pushing to catch issues early. |
| **Merge Conflicts**            | Use `git mergetool` for a graphical merge conflict resolution, or manually edit conflicted files. |
| **Accidental Force-Push**      | Use `git reflog` to find the lost commit and `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` to recover. **Avoid force-pushing shared branches.** |
| **Forgotten `.gitignore` Entries** | `git rm --cached <file>` to remove tracked files, then add to `.gitignore` and commit. |
| **Large Commits**              | Break down large changes into smaller, logical commits. Use `git add -p` for interactive staging. |
| **Commiting Directly to `main`** | Always work in feature/topic branches and use Pull Requests to merge into `main`. |
