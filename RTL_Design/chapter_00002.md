    - Don't-care conditions and their use in simplification.
  - **Karnaugh Maps (K-maps):**
    - Graphical method for simplifying Boolean expressions.
    - Grouping adjacent minterms (1s) or maxterms (0s) to find minimal expressions.
    - Handling don't-care conditions in K-maps.
  - **Multiplexers (Muxes):**
    - Functionality: Selecting one of several data inputs and forwarding it to a single output based on select inputs.
    - Implementation using logic gates.
    - Applications: Data selection, routing, function generation.
  - **Decoders:**
    - Functionality: Converting a binary code into a unique output signal.
    - Implementation using logic gates.
    - Applications: Address decoding, enabling memory or peripherals.
  - **Encoders:**
    - Functionality: Converting an active input signal into a binary code.
    - Priority encoders: Handling multiple active inputs.
    - Applications: Interrupt handling, priority arbitration.
  - **Adders:**
    - Half adder and Full adder: Building blocks for binary addition.
    - Ripple carry adder: Simple adder implementation, but slow for larger bit widths.
    - Carry lookahead adder (brief introduction): Concept of faster addition using parallel carry calculation.
  - **Multipliers (brief introduction):**
    - Basic concept of binary multiplication.
    - Array multiplier (brief overview): A common combinational multiplier architecture.

## Sequential Logic
  - **Latches:**
    - SR Latch, D Latch: Basic memory elements.
    - Level-sensitive behavior: Output changes when the enable signal is active (high or low level).
    - Transparency issues and why latches are generally avoided in synchronous designs.
  - **Flip-flops (D, SR, JK, T):**
    - D Flip-flop: Most commonly used flip-flop, data is sampled at the clock edge.
    - SR Flip-flop, JK Flip-flop, T Flip-flop: Understand their characteristic tables and behavior.
    - Edge-triggered behavior: Output changes only at the rising or falling edge of the clock.
    - Master-slave configuration (brief concept): How edge-triggering is achieved.
  - **Registers:**
    - Arrays of flip-flops: Used to store multi-bit data.
    - Parallel load and shift registers.
    - Register files (conceptual overview): Arrays of registers used in processors.
  - **Counters:**
    - Asynchronous (ripple) counters and synchronous counters.
    - Binary counters, BCD counters, up/down counters.
    - Modulo-N counters: Counters that count up to a specific value and then reset.
  - **Shift Registers:**
    - Serial-in Serial-out (SISO), Serial-in Parallel-out (SIPO), Parallel-in Serial-out (PISO), Parallel-in Parallel-out (PIPO) shift registers.
    - Applications: Serial data communication, data delay, sequence generation.

## Timing Diagrams and Basic Timing Concepts
  - **Timing Diagrams:**
    - Graphical representation of signal values as a function of time.
    - Understanding how to read and interpret timing diagrams for combinational and sequential circuits.
    - Using timing diagrams to analyze circuit behavior and identify potential timing issues.
  - **Setup Time:**
    - Definition: The minimum time data must be stable *before* the active clock edge for reliable data capture by a flip-flop.
    - Importance: Setup time violation leads to metastability and unpredictable behavior.
  - **Hold Time:**
    - Definition: The minimum time data must be stable *after* the active clock edge to ensure reliable data capture.
    - Importance: Hold time violation also leads to metastability.
  - **Clock-to-Q Delay (t<sub>cq</sub> or clk-Q):**
    - Definition: The time delay from the active clock edge to when the output of a flip-flop (Q) becomes valid.
    - Impact on circuit speed: Clock-to-Q delay contributes to the overall propagation delay in sequential circuits.
  - **Propagation Delay (for combinational logic):**
    - Definition: The time delay for a signal to propagate through a combinational logic path from input to output.
    - Impact on circuit speed: Propagation delay limits the maximum clock frequency.
  - **Clock Period and Frequency:**
    - Relationship between clock period and frequency (Frequency = 1/Period).
    - Determining the minimum clock period based on timing parameters (setup time, clock-to-Q delay, propagation delay).
