# Constrained Random Verification

## Random Stimulus Generation
Random stimulus generation creates diverse test scenarios to thoroughly test the design.

## Constraint Solving
Constraints are used to control the randomization process, ensuring valid and meaningful test cases.

## Controlling Randomization
Randomization can be controlled using constraints, seed values, and other techniques.
