# Chapter 11: Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)

## Introduction to TLM
Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) abstracts the communication between components, making verification more efficient.

## Writing and Using TLM Components
TLM components are written to model high-level transactions, reducing simulation time.

## Benefits of TLM in Verification
TLM improves verification efficiency by abstracting low-level details and focusing on high-level transactions.
