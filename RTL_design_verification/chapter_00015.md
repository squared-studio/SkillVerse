# Chapter 15: Project 2 - Verifying a Communication Protocol

## Defining Verification Requirements
Define the verification requirements for a communication protocol, including functional and performance requirements.

## Creating Constrained Random Tests
Create constrained random tests to thoroughly verify the communication protocol.

## Implementing Functional Coverage
Implement functional coverage to measure how much of the protocol's functionality has been exercised during testing.

## Exercises
1. **Define the verification requirements for a communication protocol.**
2. **Create constrained random tests for the protocol.**
3. **Implement functional coverage for the protocol.**
