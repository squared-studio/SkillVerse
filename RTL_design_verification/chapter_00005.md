# Chapter 5: Assertions in SystemVerilog

## Introduction to Assertions
Assertions are used to check for specific conditions in the design, ensuring that the design behaves as expected.

## Immediate and Concurrent Assertions
Immediate assertions are checked at a specific point in time, while concurrent assertions are checked over a period of time.

## Writing Effective Assertions
Effective assertions are clear, concise, and cover critical aspects of the design.
