# Chapter 6: Functional Coverage

## Coverage Types: Code, Functional, Assertion
Functional coverage measures how much of the design's functionality has been exercised during testing.

## Defining and Collecting Coverage
Coverage points and bins are defined to collect coverage data during simulation.

## Analyzing and Improving Coverage
Coverage data is analyzed to identify untested areas and improve test coverage.

## Exercises
1. **Describe the different types of coverage in verification.**
2. **How are coverage points and bins used in functional coverage?**
3. **Explain the process of analyzing and improving coverage.**
