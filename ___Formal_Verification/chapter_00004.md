# Chapter 4: Get Hands-On with Formal Verification Tools

## Industry Tools
Industry tools are commercial software used for formal verification. They offer advanced features and support for large designs.

### Key Tools:
- **Cadence JasperGold**: A comprehensive formal verification platform.
  - **Features**: Property checking, equivalence checking, and coverage analysis.
  - **Example**: Using JasperGold to verify a complex SoC design by writing properties and checking them against the design.
- **Synopsys VC Formal**: A tool for formal property checking and equivalence checking.
  - **Features**: Supports SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) and Property Specification Language (PSL).
  - **Example**: Using VC Formal to check the equivalence of two different implementations of a memory controller.
- **Mentor Graphics Questa Formal**: A tool for formal verification and assertion-based verification.
  - **Features**: Supports both formal and simulation-based verification.
  - **Example**: Using Questa Formal to verify the correctness of a state machine by writing assertions and running formal checks.

## Open-Source Options
Open-source tools are freely available and can be used for learning and small projects.

### Key Tools:
- **Yosys**: A framework for Verilog synthesis and formal verification.
  - **Features**: Supports various formal verification flows and integration with other tools.
  - **Example**: Using Yosys to synthesize a Verilog design and verify its properties using formal methods.
- **SymbiYosys**: A front-end for Yosys-based formal verification flows.
  - **Features**: Provides a user-friendly interface for setting up and running formal verification tasks.
  - **Example**: Using SymbiYosys to set up a formal verification flow for a simple counter design.
- **CoSA**: A formal verification tool for hardware designs.
  - **Features**: Supports property checking and model checking.
  - **Example**: Using CoSA to verify the correctness of a combinational logic circuit by writing properties and running checks.
