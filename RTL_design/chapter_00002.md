# Chapter 2: Fundamentals of Digital Logic Design

## Combinational Logic
Combinational logic circuits are those whose outputs depend only on the current inputs. Examples include logic gates, multiplexers, and arithmetic circuits.

## Sequential Logic
Sequential logic circuits have outputs that depend on both current and past inputs. They include memory elements like flip-flops and latches, which store state information.

## Flip-Flops and Latches
Flip-flops and latches are basic building blocks of sequential logic. They are used to store binary data and are essential for designing registers and memory elements.

## Basics of Timing and Clocking
Timing and clocking are critical aspects of digital design. Proper timing ensures that data is correctly transferred and processed within a circuit. Clock signals synchronize the operations of sequential circuits.

## Exercises

1. Explain the difference between combinational and sequential logic.
2. Describe the function of flip-flops and latches in digital circuits.
3. Discuss the importance of timing and clocking in digital design.
