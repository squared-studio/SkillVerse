# Chapter 9: RTL Design Optimization

## Area Optimization Techniques
Area optimization focuses on reducing the silicon area required for a design, which can lower costs and improve performance.

### Example: Area Optimization
```systemverilog
module area_optimized_adder (
    input logic [3:0] a,
    input logic [3:0] b,
    output logic [3:0] sum,
    output logic carry_out
);
    assign {carry_out, sum} = a + b;
endmodule
```

## Speed Optimization Techniques
Speed optimization aims to increase the operating frequency of a design by reducing the critical path and improving timing.

### Example: Speed Optimization
```systemverilog
module speed_optimized_adder (
    input logic [3:0] a,
    input logic [3:0] b,
    output logic [3:0] sum,
    output logic carry_out
);
    logic [3:0] p, g, c;

    assign p = a ^ b;
    assign g = a & b;
    assign c[0] = g[0];
    assign c[1] = g[1] | (p[1] & g[0]);
    assign c[2] = g[2] | (p[2] & g[1]);
    assign c[3] = g[3] | (p[3] & g[2]);
    assign sum = p ^ {c[2:0], 1'b0};
    assign carry_out = c[3];
endmodule
```

## Power Optimization Techniques
Power optimization reduces the power consumption of a design, which is critical for battery-operated devices and reducing heat dissipation.

### Example: Power Optimization
```systemverilog
module power_optimized_counter (
    input logic clk,
    input logic reset,
    output logic [3:0] count
);
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            count <= 4'b0000;
        else
            count <= count + 1;
    end
endmodule
```

## Exercises
