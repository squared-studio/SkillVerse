# Basics of Verification in SystemVerilog

## SystemVerilog Constructs for Verification
SystemVerilog provides various constructs specifically designed for verification, including classes, randomization, and assertions.

### Example
Classes: Used to create reusable verification components.
Randomization: Used to generate random test scenarios.
Assertions: Used to check for specific conditions in the design.

## Interfaces and Virtual Interfaces
Interfaces in SystemVerilog are used to group related signals together, making the testbench more modular and easier to manage. Virtual interfaces allow dynamic binding of interfaces, enhancing flexibility.

### Example
Interface: A bus interface that groups address, data, and control signals.
Virtual interface: A virtual handle to the bus interface that can be dynamically assigned to different instances.

## Randomization and Constraints
SystemVerilog supports randomization of variables to create diverse test scenarios. Constraints can be applied to control the randomization process, ensuring meaningful and valid test cases.

### Example
Randomization: Randomly generating input values for a test.
Constraints: Ensuring that generated input values meet specific conditions (e.g., address values are within a valid range).
