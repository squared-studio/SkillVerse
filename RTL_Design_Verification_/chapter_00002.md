# Verification Planning and Strategy

## Verification Plan (Test Plan)
A verification plan outlines the strategy and approach for verifying a design. It includes the scope, objectives, and resources required for the verification process.

### Example
A verification plan for a CPU design might include testing all instruction types, checking pipeline behavior, and verifying interrupt handling.

## Coverage Goals
Coverage goals define the extent to which the design needs to be tested. This includes code coverage, functional coverage, and assertion coverage.

### Example
Code coverage: Ensuring all lines of code in the design are executed during testing.
Functional coverage: Ensuring all functional scenarios (e.g., all instruction types in a CPU) are tested.
Assertion coverage: Ensuring all assertions in the design are triggered during testing.

## Defining Verification Metrics
Verification metrics are used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the verification process. Common metrics include coverage percentage, number of tests passed/failed, and bug count.

### Example
Coverage percentage: 95% code coverage indicates that 95% of the design code has been executed during testing.
Number of tests passed/failed: 1000 tests passed, 10 tests failed.
Bug count: 5 critical bugs, 10 major bugs, 20 minor bugs.

## Exercises
1. **What is the purpose of a verification plan?**
2. **List and describe three types of coverage goals.**
3. **Explain the importance of verification metrics and provide examples.**
