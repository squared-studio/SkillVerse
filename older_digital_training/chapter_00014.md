## Virtual Methods
  - Define a base class with a virtual method.
  - Define a derived class that overrides this method.
  - Instantiate both classes and call the method to observe the behavior.

## Static Variables/Functions
  - Define a class with a static variable and a static method.
  - Instantiate the class multiple times and observe the behavior of the static members.

## Copying Objects
  - Define a class with several properties.
  - Instantiate an object of this class and then create a copy of it.
  - Modify the original object and observe the effect on the copy.

## Parameterized Classes
  - Define a parameterized class.
  - Instantiate this class with different parameters in a testbench.

## `extern`
  - Define a class with an `extern` method.
  - Provide the implementation of this method outside the class.
  - Instantiate the class and call the `extern` method.

## Local Access Level
  - Define a class with `local` methods and properties.
  - Try to access these members from outside the class and observe the behavior.

## Abstract Class
  - Define an abstract class with a pure virtual method.
  - Define a derived class that implements this method.
  - Instantiate the derived class and call the method.

## Randomization
  - Define a class with several properties.
  - Write a method that randomizes these properties.
  - Instantiate the class and call the method to generate different sets of property values.
