## Program Block
  - Write a SystemVerilog program that uses a program block to encapsulate a sequence of procedural statements.
  - Experiment with different types of program blocks (e.g., initial, always, final) and observe their behavior.

## Dynamic Cast
  - Define a base class and a derived class.
  - Write a testbench that creates an object of the base class, performs a dynamic cast to the derived class, and checks the result of the cast.

## Package
  - Define a package that includes a class definition and some functions.
  - Write a testbench that imports the package and uses its contents.

## Command Line Input
  - Write a SystemVerilog program that reads command line inputs using the `$value$plusargs` or `$test$plusargs` system functions.
  - Run the program with different command line arguments and observe the results.

## File I/O
  - Write a SystemVerilog program that opens a file, writes some data to it, and then closes it.
  - Modify the program to read the data back from the file and print it.

## Scope Resolution Operator
  - Define a class with a local variable and a method that accesses the variable.
  - Write a testbench that creates an object of the class, accesses the variable using the scope resolution operator, and calls the method.
