## Constraints
  - Define a class with several properties and write constraints for them.
  - Instantiate the class and randomize it to observe the effect of the constraints.

## Random Variables
  - Define a class with a random variable.
  - Write a testbench that randomizes this variable and prints its value.

## Constraint Blocks
  - Define a class with several constraint blocks.
  - Instantiate the class and randomize it to observe the effect of the different constraint blocks.

## Array Randomization
  - Define a class with an array and write constraints for the array elements.
  - Instantiate the class and randomize it to generate different arrays that satisfy the constraints.

## Constraint Examples
  - Look at some examples of constraints and try to understand how they work.
  - Write your own constraints based on these examples.

## `inside` Constraint
  - Define a class with a property and a constraint that uses the `inside` keyword.
  - Instantiate the class and randomize it to generate values that satisfy the `inside` constraint.

## Implication Constraint
  - Define a class with a property and an implication constraint.
  - Instantiate the class and randomize it to observe the effect of the implication constraint.

## `foreach` Constraint
  - Define a class with an array and a `foreach` constraint.
  - Instantiate the class and randomize it to generate arrays that satisfy the `foreach` constraint.
