## Class
  - Define a simple class with a few properties and methods.
  - Instantiate the class in a testbench and call its methods.

## Class Handle/Object
  - Modify the class from the previous exercise to include a handle to another object of the same class.
  - Write a method that uses this handle to interact with the other object.

## Class Constructor
  - Add a constructor to the class that initializes its properties.
  - Instantiate the class with different initial values in the testbench.

## `this` Keyword
  - Write a method that uses the `this` keyword to refer to the object it's called on.
  - Call this method from the testbench and observe its behavior.

## `super` Keyword
  - Define a subclass of the class from the previous exercises.
  - Use the `super` keyword in the subclass to call a method from the superclass.

## `typedef` Class
  - Use `typedef` to define a new type based on the class.
  - Instantiate this new type in the testbench.

## Inheritance
  - Define another subclass of the class, adding some new properties and methods.
  - Instantiate both subclasses in the testbench and call their methods.

## Polymorphism
  - Write a function that takes a handle to the superclass as an argument.
  - Call this function with objects of both subclasses and observe the behavior.
