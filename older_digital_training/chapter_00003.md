# Task 3 : Digital Circuit Components

## NOT Gate
A NOT gate, also known as an inverter, has one input and one output. The output is the inverse of the input. If the input is 1, the output is 0, and vice versa.

## AND Gate
An AND gate has two inputs and one output. The output is 1 only if both inputs are 1. Otherwise, the output is 0.

## OR Gate
An OR gate also has two inputs and one output. The output is 1 if either or both of the inputs are 1. If both inputs are 0, the output is 0.

## XOR Gate
An XOR (Exclusive OR) gate gives a high output (1) if an odd number of inputs are high (1). If an even number of inputs are high, or if all inputs are low, the output is low (0).

## NAND Gate
A NAND gate is an AND gate followed by a NOT gate. It has two inputs and one output. The output is 0 only if both inputs are 1. Otherwise, the output is 1.

## NOR Gate
A NOR gate is an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. It has two inputs and one output. The output is 1 only if both inputs are 0. Otherwise, the output is 0.

## XNOR Gate
An XNOR (Exclusive NOR) gate gives a high output (1) if an even number of inputs are high. If an odd number of inputs are high, or if all inputs are low, the output is low (0).
