## Functional Coverage
  - Write a testbench that includes a functional coverage model for a simple design.
  - Run the testbench and analyze the coverage results.

## Covergroup and Coverpoint
  - Define a covergroup with several coverpoints.
  - Write a testbench that samples the covergroup and prints the coverage results.

## Coverpoint Bins
  - Modify the covergroup from the previous exercise to include bins for the coverpoints.
  - Run the testbench again and analyze the bin coverage results.

## Assertions
  - Write a testbench that includes assertions to check the behavior of a simple design.
  - Run the testbench and observe the assertion results.

## Immediate Assertions
  - Add some immediate assertions to the testbench from the previous exercise.
  - Run the testbench and observe the immediate assertion results.

## Concurrent Assertions
  - Replace some of the immediate assertions in the testbench with concurrent assertions.
  - Run the testbench and observe the concurrent assertion results.

## Sequence (`rose`, `fell`, `stable`)
  - Write a sequence that uses the `rose`, `fell`, and `stable` operators.
  - Include this sequence in an assertion in the testbench and observe the results.

## Assertions with Time Delay
  - Write an assertion that includes a time delay.
  - Include this assertion in the testbench and observe the results.
