# Chapter 1: Solidify Your Foundations

## Digital Logic and Boolean Algebra
Digital logic forms the basis of digital circuits. It involves understanding how digital systems operate using binary values (0s and 1s). Boolean algebra is a mathematical approach to analyzing and simplifying digital circuits.

### Key Concepts:
- **Logic Gates**: Basic building blocks of digital circuits. Examples include:
  - **AND Gate**: Outputs true only if all inputs are true.
  - **OR Gate**: Outputs true if at least one input is true.
  - **NOT Gate**: Outputs the inverse of the input.
  - **NAND Gate**: Outputs false only if all inputs are true.
  - **NOR Gate**: Outputs true only if all inputs are false.
  - **XOR Gate**: Outputs true if an odd number of inputs are true.
  - **XNOR Gate**: Outputs true if an even number of inputs are true.
- **Boolean Expressions**: Mathematical expressions that represent the logic of a digital circuit. Simplifying these expressions can make circuits more efficient.
  - **Example**: The expression A AND (B OR C) can be simplified using Boolean algebra rules.
- **Karnaugh Maps**: A visual method to simplify Boolean expressions. It helps in minimizing the number of logic gates needed.
  - **Example**: A Karnaugh map for the expression A AND B can help identify common patterns and simplify the expression.

## Finite State Machines (FSMs)
FSMs are models of computation used to design both computer programs and sequential logic circuits. They consist of a finite number of states and transitions between those states.

### Key Concepts:
- **States**: Different conditions or modes of operation of the system.
  - **Example**: A traffic light system has states like "Red", "Green", and "Yellow".
- **Transitions**: Rules that determine state changes based on inputs.
  - **Example**: The traffic light changes from "Red" to "Green" after a timer expires.
- **State Diagrams**: Visual representation of FSMs showing states and transitions.
  - **Example**: A diagram showing the traffic light states and the conditions for changing states.
- **Types of FSMs**:
  - **Mealy Machine**: Outputs depend on both the current state and the inputs.
  - **Moore Machine**: Outputs depend only on the current state.
