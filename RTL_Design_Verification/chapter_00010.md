# Scoreboarding and Self-Checking Testbenches

## Scoreboarding Concepts
Scoreboards are used to compare expected and actual outputs, ensuring the correctness of the design.

## Implementing Scoreboards
Scoreboards are implemented as part of the testbench to automate result checking.

## Self-Checking Mechanisms
Self-checking testbenches automatically verify the correctness of the design without manual intervention.

## Exercises
1. **What is a scoreboard in verification?**
2. **How are scoreboards implemented in a testbench?**
3. **Explain the concept of self-checking testbenches.**
